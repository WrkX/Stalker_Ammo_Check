# V2.2 is now live #

# The Stalker Anomaly **Ammo Check** Mod for RC18+ #

This mod lets you create a keybind in the settings to check how much ammo is left in the magazine. At the same time it hides the default ammo counter on the bottom right.

## How to install ##
Download the release you want (v2.0 for the Anomaly Magazines version, v1.5 for the independent one).

Unzip the folder and drag the gamedata folder into your your stalker folder.

## How to change the keybind ##
Open the ingame control settings and set the Ammo Check button to whatever you want.

If you use the *Ammo Type Check 2 keybinds*-Edition you can also find the button config there.
