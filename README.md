# The Stalker Anomaly **Ammo Check** Mod for RC18 #

This mod lets you create a keybind in the settings to check how much ammo is left in the magazine. At the same time it hides the default ammo counter on the bottom right.

## How to install ##
### Easy Mode ###
Check the release and download the version you want.

### Not as Easy ###
Unzip the file and drag the content of the **1. Base** folder into Stalker Anomaly/
* *if you have [Weapon Parts Overhaul](https://www.moddb.com/mods/stalker-anomaly/addons/weapon-parts-overhaul) or [POWERED EXOSKELETONS](https://www.moddb.com/mods/stalker-anomaly/addons/exo-u5),*
*open 1.1 Compatibility Patches BASE EDITION and drag the Compatibility patch you need into Stalker Anomaly/ and overwrite everything.*

* If you want to use the Ammo Type Check, drag one of the two versions into Stalker Anomaly/ and overwrite again (and apply compatibility patches if needed).


## How to change the keybind ##
Open the ingame control settings and set the Ammo Check button to whatever you want.

If you use the *Ammo Type Check 2 keybinds*-Edition you can also find the button config there.
